This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.
## Step 0: check you configuration.
 Ensure you have those environment variables set
 ```shell
 # React native
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/10.0/bin
 ```
You could add those to your favorite shell configuration (like ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc).
You should also create a .env file:
```.env
DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN=<DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN>
DATADOG_ENVIRONMENT=<DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN>
DATADOG_APPLICATION_ID=<DATADOG_CLIENT_TOKEN>
DATADOG_TRACK_USER_INTERACTIONS=true
DATADOG_TRACK_XHR_RESOURCES=true
DATADOG_TRACK_ERRORS=true
DATADOG_PROXY_HOST=localhost
DATADOG_PROXY_PORT=8443
DATADOG_PROXY_TYPE=https
```
Proxy configuration entries are optional: the should not be removed if not used.
DATADOG_PROXY_TYPE can be https, http or socks as documented.
Whenever your environment is changed you should perform those commands to ensure it is taken into account:
```shell
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npm run android
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
